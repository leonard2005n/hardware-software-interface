# Task: Warning (No Error)

Navigate to `tasks/include-fix/support`.

Run the `make` command and you will get a warning.
Is this related to the compiler, or the linker?

Solve this warning by editing the `support/hello.c` file.
Do so without using the `#include` directive.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through [this relevant section](../../reading/calling-convention.md) of the reading material.
