# Task: Maximum Calculation in Assembly with Call from C (32-bit version)

This is the exact same task as the last, with one major difference.

Take note of the distinctions.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through [this relevant section](../../reading/calling-convention.md) of the reading material.
